# World Cup Timeline

### About
World Cup Timeline is a small front-end JavaScript project completed over several days. I built it as a means of trying
out the visjs library as well as the YouTube API. I also thought it would be an interesting way to display the history of
the world's most important sporting event in a innovative and visually appealing way.


### Technologies
As noted, this project uses the visjs library and YouTube API to build its interactive timeline. To check out the site, visit
